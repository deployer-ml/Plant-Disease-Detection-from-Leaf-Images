## Key Features
- üñºÔ∏è Image classification for 38 types of plant diseases
- üå± Supports multiple plant species including tomato, potato, pepper, etc.
- üî¨ Uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) for accurate detection
- üì± Lightweight model suitable for mobile deployment
- üìä Detailed classification reports and confidence scores

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-leaf-disease-detection.git
cd plant-leaf-disease-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Place your plant leaf images in the `test_images/` folder
2. Run the detection script:
```bash
python app.py --image_path test_images/your_image.jpg
```

## Dataset
The model was trained on the [PlantVillage Dataset](https://plantvillage.psu.edu/) containing over 54,000 images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.

## Model Architecture
The system uses a custom CNN architecture with:
- 5 convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- 3 max-pooling layers
- 2 fully connected layers
- Dropout for regularization

## Results
| Metric        | Value   |
|---------------|---------|
| Accuracy      | 98.2%   |
| Precision     | 98.1%   |
| Recall        | 98.0%   |
| F1-Score      | 98.0%   |
